Hello.
>About me:
> I am currently enrolled in UTRGV seeking to major in Computer Science. My goal is to one day find myself in a position in which I can be able to solve problems and analyze issues assigned to me; therefore, I am fine getting a bachelor's and, hopefully, a master's one day, whether in engineering or CS. My interests are quite average as I enjoy things that encompass normal activities, such as walking and writing, as well as I enjoy being surrounded by people even if I do not necessarily interact with them.
